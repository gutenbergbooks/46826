<h2>THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Founded upon the Farce of Christmas
Cards.</i>)</p>

<p class="hang">Scene&mdash;<i>A London Drawing Room.</i>
<span class="smcap">Paterfamilias</span> <i>discovered reading
a paper, and</i> <span class="smcap">Materfamilias</span>
<i>superintending the despatch of a
number of cards</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> (<i>in a tone of irritation</i>).
I really think, <span class="smcap">John</span>, that, considering
you have nothing earthly
to do this afternoon, you might
come and help me.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> You have said that twice
before, my dear. Don't you see I
am enjoying myself?</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> So like you! As if you
couldn't give up that stupid paper&mdash;you
declare there's no news in
it&mdash;and do me a favour!</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>putting down his paper</i>).
Well, anything for a quiet life!
What is it?</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> I am sending a card to
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>taking up his paper
again</i>). Send it.</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> My dear <span class="smcap">John</span>, <i>do</i> attend.
I want to know what I shall put
into the envelope.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>giving up paper, and examining
Christmas Cards with
some vague show of interest</i>). Oh,
well&mdash;here. (<i>Casually picking up
a picture of a country churchyard
by moonlight</i>). Won't this be the
sort of thing?</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> (<i>shocked</i>). How <i>can</i> you,
John! Don't you know that Mrs.
Brown lost her husband only a year
ago?</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> Then why are you wishing
her "A Merry Christmas"?</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> Well, you see she has
married again, and so I thought of
sending her something with "A
Happy New Year" in it.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>taking up a card showing
an owl in an ivy bush</i>). Why not
this?</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> Well that would be better,
but then she might think that the
owl was intended for a sneer at her
second husband. And then I always
like to keep the happy new
year cards till Christmas is over, as
you can send them afterwards to
the people who have remembered
you when you have forgotten
them.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> But you wouldn't have
"A Merry Christmas," and now you
object to "A Happy New Year."
What <i>do</i> you want?</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> Can't you get something
impersonal?</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>taking up card</i>). Well,
here's a yacht in full sail.</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> Oh, <i>how</i> cruel! It will
remind her of her cousin who was
lost at sea!</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>selecting another sketch</i>).
Then why not this bouquet of
flowers?</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> Not for worlds! One
never knows what the flowers may
mean, and we might offend her.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>trying again</i>). Well, here
is a windmill.</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> My dear John, you are
absolutely provoking. A windmill
is suggestive of frivolity, and I
wouldn't let Mrs. Brown think that
we meant <i>that</i> on any account.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>making another selection</i>).
Well, here's a parrot in a
cage.</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> You surely are not
serious? Fancy sending such a
card! Why, as everyone knows
that dear Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown</span> is rather
talkative, all the world would say
it was an "insult."</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>losing patience</i>). Oh,
hang Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> I am ashamed of you,
<span class="smcap">John</span>! And I suppose you would
hang the cards, too! You would
curse "Merry Christmas."</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>promptly</i>). That I would,
and what is more, I would&mdash;well
never mind&mdash;the glad New Year!</p>

<h2>THREE CHRISTMAS GREETINGS.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before the fireside's ruddy glow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I sit, and let my thoughts fly free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, these my Christmas greetings go<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To three good friends beyond the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain is the winter tempest's wrack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It cannot keep my greetings back.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh wind and rain, and rain and wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How purposeless and blind ye are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like fate, for fate was surely blind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That bade my three friends range afar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like mine, perchance, their fancy strays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To other scenes and distant days.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear <span class="smcap">Frank</span>, I think I see you now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My flaxen-haired American,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave heart, grey eye, unclouded brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two stalwart yards of wilful man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft in laughter and in song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With you I sped the hours along.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah me, the days were all too short,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Too swift the unreturning hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that old town of Hall and court,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of ancient gateways flanked with towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where once we feared the near exam...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dared the dons, and stirred the Cam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You went, and now expound the law<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(As <i>Bumble</i> said, the law's a hass)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And argue, as I note with awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For litigants in Boston, Mass.;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though you wear no warlike suit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call you "General" to boot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, how fares it now with you<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In that drear country of the North?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too great your needs, your means too few,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A whim of temper drove you forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On far Vancouver's shore, alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You hear the sad Pacific moan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With us, God wot, you little throve;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your life all fire, and storm, and fret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against relentless fate you strove,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But strove in vain&mdash;and yet, and yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God shapes in storm and fire his plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moulds a world or makes a man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Good luck be yours on that bleak shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some fortunate, some golden prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then be it mine to see once more<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those friendly, lustrous, Irish eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return and face with us your fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world is small and England great.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You shall return and fill your place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But never shall I clasp his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose bright and smiling boyish face<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Makes sunshine in the shadowland.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shall the night my heart beguile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let me dream I see him smile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your voice I may not hear again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh dear and unforgotten friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beloved, but ah! beloved in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whom love could mourn, but not defend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still take, though far and lost you dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love, dear <span class="smcap">Hugh</span>, and so farewell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus before the fireside's glow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I sit and let my thoughts fly free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, these my Christmas greetings go<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To three good friends beyond the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To <span class="smcap">Frank</span>, to <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, and ah, to you,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Every dog has his day&mdash;so they say,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And mine it seems comes round once a year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the painter fellows mix their blacks and browns and yellows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And paint me, in some attitude that's queer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unnatural, and silly; spilling milk or supping skilly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a bonnet or a bib on, or tied up in bows of ribbon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the Dogs' "Decline and Fall" might inspire a doggish Gibbon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they make me most unhappy, and my temper sharp and snappy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do these pictures poor and pappy. I'm a decent doggish chappie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in gaudy Christmas Numbers, watching o'er the sloppy slumbers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a baby pink and podgy; or squatting scared and stodgy,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Or chasing that old rat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down that everlasting hole in the stable! On my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dog as is a dog, and not a duffer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Yuletide pictures come is bound to suffer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endless agonies of shame at the loss of his good name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sonsie friend of man, and a watchful guar-di-an,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">baby in the cap, or the kid (who needs a slap) and the pug (not<br /></span>

<span class="i4">a-sniffing at a trap, or essaying milk to lap, like a small pot-bellied<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Jap; and all the old clap-trap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which makes a decent doggy in sheer desperation say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he'd rather be a kitten with a ball and string to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or live on clockwork rats, or make breakfast on chopped hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or be smeared all o'er with mustard like a cold beef sandwich,&mdash;Aye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or&mdash;<i>whisper!</i>&mdash;Bite a Baby!!&mdash;on the nose!! in nursery play!!!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better dare renewed distemper than another Christmas Day!!<br /></span>

<h2>AN AFTERPART À LA L. C. C.</h2>

<p>As the L. C. C. have taken in hand the morals of the music halls,
and shown an inclination to supersede the Lord Chamberlain, it
may be as well to publish a rough sketch of a specimen scene from
the afterpart of a pantomime for the guidance of theatrical managers
desirous of standing well with the successors to the members of the
Metropolitan Board of Works. The "opening" would, of course, be
written by "a serious bard with a mission." No doubt the story
would be told in a manner most productive to the manufacture of
prigs. The transformation over, Clown, Pantaloon, Harlequin and
Columbine would be discovered in a group.</p>

<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>in the conventional tone)</i>. Here we are again!</p>

<p><i>Bumble</i> (<i>representing the L. C. C.</i>). Scarcely. Allow me to point
out that in future you will be entirely different.</p>

<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>as before</i>). Come along, old'un; let's make a butter slide.</p>

<p><i>Bumble.</i> You must permit me to interpose. The Council cannot
recognise any practical joke of the kind. If you wish to have the
same sort of fun, pull up the streets in the most frequented thoroughfares
in the metropolis&mdash;the Strand and Fleet Street for choice.</p>

<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>as before</i>). Oh, here's a baby! Let's smash it!</p>

<p><i>Bumble.</i> Please accept my advice. The Council do not object to
the keeping down of babies in the abstract. But personal violence is
contrary to the law. If you really wish to decrease the surplus
population, why not work it to death at a board-school? It may
be a slower process than throwing it over a lamp-post, but the
incident will be truer to life, and therefore more convincing.</p>

<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>as before</i>). Oh! old 'un, here's a peeler coming!</p>

<p><i>Bumble</i>. Pray be under no apprehension. Until the Police Force
is placed under the direct control of the Council, the members will
do their best to protect you. It stands to reason that a great
community like London should have its own guardians under its
own direct control.</p>

<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>as before</i>). And now let's jump through this building.</p>

<p><i>Bumble</i>. Again I must put my veto upon your proceedings. If
you were to jump through that wall no doubt a placard would appear
bearing the legend "Somersault Place." This might be apt, but no
change in the nomenclature of the streets can be permitted without
the direct sanction of Spring Gardens.</p>

<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>as before</i>). And now let's pelt this house, and all who's in it!</p>

<p><i>Bumble.</i> Stop, stop! You are attacking our own sacred building.
(<i>To</i> Harlequin). Will you be so good as to change the <i>locale</i>. (Harlequin
<i>strikes building, which turns into the Mansion House</i>.) Now
you may do what you please. For the Corporation of the City of
London is so effete that we have no sympathy for it!</p>

<h2>AT THE WESTMINSTER PLAY</h2>

<p><i>Plaudite! Bravo! Brave!</i>
<i>Domini Quippus et Punnus</i> are
very much alive! A fact that
may be inferred from just one
line (there are more whence this
came) in the Westminsterial
play, when <i>Davus</i> takes <i>Mysis</i>
"the New Woman," for his
wife, and exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Mysis, Mysis, tu mea Missis eris!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Surely if the punhating Criticus
Sagitarius (Mundi) were present
he must have staggered out
weeping on hearing the Latin-Anglo-modern-classical
pun! O
shade of 'Arry Stophanes! O
Ghost of Terence (the Corkasian)!
are our youths at Westminster
to start thus on their career, with
nothing better than a poor pun
not worth a punny in their
pockets! Let Sagitarius watch
this youthful punster's line of
life! He will live to be punished!
or to be rewarded as he deserves?
After all, Great Pun is not dead;
he may be dull, commonplace
sometimes, but as he was prehistoric,
so is he immortal.
There is a great future before
the author of the Westminster
epilogue.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>A Baronitess junior sends word from the children's quarters that
<i>Your Fortune and Character</i> is an amusing game, told by <span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>, but published by <span class="smcap">John Jaques &amp; Co.</span>&mdash;evidently not a
descendant of the "melancholy <span class="smcap">Jaques</span>," for he would have "rail'd
on Lady Fortune in good terms" had the game been at his expense.</p>

<p>Massa <span class="smcap">Blackie &amp; Son</span> send in a story by <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>, always so
Hentytaining, entitled <i>When London Burned</i>. We all ken that
when Rome burned <span class="smcap">Nero</span> fiddled, but this hero&mdash;not an 'ero&mdash;had
every opportunity of extinguishing&mdash;my Baronite means "distinguishing
himself;" and our cavalier availed himself, after many
other wondrous episodes, to rush with warm enthusiasm to throw
cold water on this enlightenment of London. Needless to remark,
he came scatheless through the fire!</p>

<p><i>From Snowdon to the Sea</i>, by <span class="smcap">Marie Trevelyan</span>, shows us Wales
in the days of <i>Merlin</i> and mythical superstitions, likewise of queer
doings on the part of bold, bad buccaneers, in whom we seem to trace
something of the origin of the modern Welsher.</p>

<p>A perfect black and white school romance is continued in <i>My Lost
Manuscript</i>, by <span class="smcap">Maggie Symington</span> (<span class="smcap">Wells, Gardner and Darton</span>).
Evidently this youthful writer had not read the wise counsels
conveyed in a manual <i>On the Art of Writing Fiction</i> (brought out by
same publishers), or so much ink would not have been wasted. "After
perusing this cheery little book, the much encouraged aspirant,"
quoth our Baronitess with a sigh, "for literary fame, will promptly
lay down the pen and write no more." Good news for the editors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Braddon</span>, in her delightful story <i>Christmas Hirelings</i> (<span class="smcap">Simpkins,
Marshall &amp; Co.</span>), hits upon a novel suggestion for those folks
who don't know how to keep the festive season as it should be kept.
Away flies boredom! How? I will not reveal the secret, but if any
nicely suppressed little children possess an average Scrooge-like
relative, take my advice, and present him with this book. The
result will be more than even a child's dream can anticipate. Rather
powder in jam to boys will be <i>The Battle of Frogs and Mice</i>, by
<span class="smcap">Jane Barlow</span> (<span class="smcap">Methuen</span>), who is evidently a distant connection of
the immortal <i>Mr. Barlow</i>, with so much kind thought for youthful
learning. It may be Greek to many who have but a dim, far-off
knowledge of the first great burlesque writer: but this his
book will bring it all Homer again to us. Quite a relief to turn to
our dear <i>Nonsense Songs and Stories</i>, by <span class="smcap">Edward Lear</span> (<span class="smcap">Frederick
Warne &amp; Co.</span>) Vague yellow undulating pessimism notwithstanding,
how pleasant is real good nonsense! And even the fairy story
cannot be crushed by our juggernaut modern science, than which the
imaginative impossible, as in <i>Thought Fairies</i>, by <span class="smcap">Helen Waters</span>,
and in the <i>Seven Imps</i>, by <span class="smcap">Kathleen Wallis</span>, is so much more
attractive to youthful brains. Both books issued by <span class="smcap">Digby, Long,
&amp; Co.</span>, and wise of them to do so. <span class="smcap">Macmillans</span> issue a splendid new
edition of the wonderful <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, with over a hundred
illustrations by <span class="smcap">Charles E. Brock</span>, which ought to make the book
go off like <span class="smcap">Brock's</span> fireworks. Its very warm cover suggests a seasonable
book, <i>A Righte Merrie Christmasse</i>, by <span class="smcap">John Ashton</span> (<i>Leadenhall
Press</i>), who, fancying that some of its customs and privileges
might be forgotten, collects all that has been done or could be done
at this annual event. Some of ye anciente goinges on make one
wonder whether feasts were better kept when they spelt with such
unreasonable euphony. It must have been "merrie in halle" when
the wassail song was ordinarily sung as depicted by <span class="smcap">A. C. Behrend</span>
in his exquisite copper etching.</p>

<p><i>London Society</i> is peculiarly bright and cheerful this Yuletide,
and keeps up its excellent reputation. A good medley is <i>London
Society</i>. And here is a very bright little <i>Woman</i> this Christmastide.
Quite a festive party with her capital stories and supplement
of "Types of the World's Women." Just "Woman, lovely
woman" in all styles and shades. Without being more vain than
any other average islander, one feels grateful for belonging to the
British group&mdash;no offence to the other ladies, to whom we take off our
hat, and, whilst including the rest, salute advancing <i>Woman</i>. "And
it is this New <i>Woman</i>, not <i>the</i> New Woman of the period, whom,"
quoth the Baron, "I salute with pleasure," and to whom he wishes
a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year, and signs himself</p>

<h2>READING BETWEEN THE LINES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Physician's Protest.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;As a specialist of some standing and experience,
I wish, Sir, to call attention, through the medium of
your valuable paper, to the injurious effects of a certain occupation
upon the minds of the individuals engaged therein, and
their protection.</p>

<p>The occupation to which I refer is that of devising and
arranging what I understand are technically known as "headlines"
for the contents-bills of the more inexpensive London
evening papers&mdash;an occupation which I have no hesitation in
characterising, on evidence unconsciously supplied by the
sufferers themselves, as highly dangerous employment.</p>

<p>I am not sufficiently versed, Sir, to the <i>minutiæ</i> of newspaper
routine, to know what precise class of persons are
entrusted with this particular responsibility, though I have a
strong suspicion that it may be one of the many forms of
degrading drudgery which the selfishness of man has imposed
upon the weaker sex. If so, of course it only increases the
necessity for interference.</p>

<p>And, whoever and whatever the persons performing such
duties may be, it is painfully obvious that they are labouring
under conditions of mental excitement, the strain of which no
nervous system can support for any length of time without
inevitable and complete collapse.</p>

<p>Should there be any who consider this an overstatement on
my part, I merely ask them to give a glance at some of these
same content-sheets which are nightly displayed in our chief
thoroughfares. Let them mark the monstrous size of the
lettering, the peculiar extravagance of the epithets selected,
the morbid insistence upon unpleasant details, and then doubt,
if they can, that the unhappy persons employed in such an
industry are affected thereby with some obscure form of
hysteria. Otherwise, let me ask you, Sir, is it likely, is it
credible, that seasoned journalists, tough men of the world, in
touch with life at innumerable points, could, in a normal state
of health, be so constantly "Startled," "Amazed," "Astounded,"
"Shocked," "Appalled," and "Revolted," as they admit themselves
to be, almost every evening, by reports and rumours
which a little reflection would convince them were utterly
unfounded, or by events too ordinary and commonplace, one
might have supposed, to upset the mental equilibrium of a
neurotic rabbit?</p>

<p>Occasionally, too, there are symptoms of an excessive reverence
for rank, which, when found in the more democratic
organs (where, indeed, they are chiefly observable), denote a
somewhat distempered state of intellect, the delusion apparently
being that the mere possession of any sort of title renders its
owner immaculate. Thus, they announce with awestricken
solemnity "A Peer's Peccadilloes," or "A Baronet Bilks his
Baker," giving these events a poster all to themselves, as others
would an earthquake, or some portent of direst significance.</p>

<p>Now this loss of the sense of proportion in human affairs, Sir, is a
very bad sign, and a well-nigh infallible indicator of nerve-strain
and general overpressure.</p>

<p>But I find a yet more unmistakable evidence in support of my
contention in the extraordinary emotional sensibility revealed by these
headlines whenever some unfortunate person has been sentenced to
death for the most commonplace murder. There is clearly a profound
conviction that the jury who heard the evidence, the judge who pronounced
their verdict of guilty, the only possible conclusion they
could reasonable come to, and the <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> who found himself
unable to recommend a reprieve, were, one and all, engaged in a
cold-blooded conspiracy against a perfectly innocent man. The convict
has said to himself, and that seems to be considered sufficient.
And so, night after night, the authors of these headlines harrow themselves
by announcing such items as "Blank protests his innocence to
his Solicitor." "A petition in Preparation." "Painful Interview."
"Blank Hopeful." "Blank Depressed." "Distressing Scene on
the Scaffold." "Blank's Last Words."</p>

<p>Consider the strain of all these alterations of hope and despair,
repeated time after time, and almost invariably without even the
consolation of deferring the fate of their <i>protégé</i> by a single hour!
Is it not too much for the strongest constitution to endure? a
service which the society has no right to demand from any of its
members?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, whether these devoted servants of the public know it or
not, they are running a most frightful risk; the word which hangs
above their heads may fall at any moment.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example&mdash;and it is surely not wholly an imaginary
danger I foresee&mdash;suppose that some day some event should happen
somewhere of real and serious importance. Have they left themselves
any epithet in reserve capable of expressing their sensations at
all adequately? They have not; they have squandered participles
and adjectives in such reckless profusion that they will discover they
are reduced to the condition of inarticulate bankrupts; and, speaking
as a medical man, acute cerebral congestion would be the very least
result that I should anticipate.</p>

<p>Or the determining shock might come from more trivial causes.
For instance, we might lose a distinguished statesman, or an ironclad,
at the very moment when a football match was decided, or when
the professional tipster attached to their particular journal published
his "finals." Think of the mental conflict before determining the
relative importance of these events, and awarding one or the other
its proper prominence on the posters; and then ask yourself, Sir,
whether it is an ordeal that any human being of an impressionable,
excitable temperament should be required to undergo.</p>

<p>What precise remedy should be adopted I do not profess to point
out. Perhaps some one of the numerous leagues established to protect
adult citizens against themselves might take the matter up, and
insist upon these contents-bills being set up for the future in smaller
type and with epithets of a more temperate order. Perhaps Parliament
or the London County Council might be asked to interfere.
All that is not within my province, Sir, but this I do say: unless
some measures are taken <i>soon</i>, the heavy responsibility will be upon
us of having permitted a small but deserving class of our fellow-creatures
to hurry themselves into premature mental decay by the
pernicious and unwholesome nature of their employment.</p>

<h2>CURIOUS ACCIDENT TO MRS. RAMSBOTHAM.</h2>

<p>Strolling through Pimlico the other day
Mrs. R. was attracted by evidence of a sale
by auction going forward in one of the residences
in that desirable quarter. Having
half an hour to spare she thought she would
look in. "I was quite surprised," she writes
to her son, "when I entered the room to see
a gentleman standing in a pulpit which I
knew was Mr. <span class="smcap">Pipchose</span>, leastway, his
whiskers were not so mutton-choppy; but I
could not mistake him, though meeting him
only once at tea at Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown's</span> where he
was very pressing with the muffins. He
looked at me in just the same meaning way
as when he said, 'Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ram</span>. won't you take
another piece of sugar, though as I know it's
carrying coals to Newcastle?' I'm not above
recognising my friends, wherever I meet
them, and gave him a friendly nod, and
before I knew where I was, I found I had
bought for £3 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a wool mattress; a pair
of tongs (rather bent); a barometer (with the
quicksilver missing); a small iron bedstead;
a set of tea-things (mostly cracked); an armchair,
and a sofa warranted hair-stuffed, but
certainly having only three legs. It wasn't
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pipchose</span> at all, as I might have known
if I had taken another look at his whiskers,
but only a forward auctioneer."</p>

<p>"The Chinese Government," observed the
<i>City Times</i> last week, "is seeking new
channels for money." Decidedly China is in
straits, and will soon be apparently quite at sea.

<h2>FIRST IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

<div class="figright w25">
<a href="images/309b.png">
<img src="images/309b.png"
alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Genoa in November. It is summer time. Put on thin suit, drink
my <i>café au lait</i> by open window, and stroll out into beautiful
Genoa, basking in the sunshine. <i>Déjeuner</i> in the garden of
a restaurant, among the old palaces. Sit in the shade, without my
hat. Think of all the poor people in
London. Wonder if anyone is having a
frugal lunch at the funny little open-air
restaurant in Hyde Park. Lemonade
and a bath bun in a fog. Should imagine
not.</p>

<p>Charming place, Genoa. Hardly any
Germans. Can at last hear people talking
Italian. In Venice there are so
many Germans that one might as well be
in Germany. Sitting out on the Piazza,
one hears incessantly their monotonous,
guttural chatter, always in the same tone
of voice, without inflections, without
emotion, and, worst of all, without end.
Watched at the hotel <i>table d'hôte</i> a German
lady sitting between two German
gentlemen. One man talked loudly without
ceasing, mouth full or mouth empty,
from soup to dessert. The other man,
rather older and feebler, also talked
without ceasing, but he could not equal
the other's noise; he only added to it. As for the lady, her lips
moved all the time; one could imagine the <i>ja wohl</i>, the <i>ach, so?</i> the
<i>ja, ja, ja</i>, but one could not hear a word. At Florence, at Milan, on
the Lakes it is the same. If by chance one hears a Frenchman speak,
his charming language sounds more vivacious and melodious than
ever before. So it is good to be in Genoa, where even the best hotel
is kept by Italians. Apparently every other good hotel in Italy is
kept by <span class="smcap">Herr Schmidt</span>, or <span class="smcap">Herr Weber</span>, or <span class="smcap">Herr Somethingorother</span>,
and all the servants are German also. There is one hotel in Genoa
kept by a German. It faces the harbour. All night long there are
whistles, screams, bangs, rumblings, bumps, roars, and other sounds
from trains, ships, and tramways. All day long there is the same
noise, only more of it. But the Germans do not mind; they talk just
the same, and they make each other hear through it all.</p>

<p>Charming place, Genoa, with a town hall that is the gayest
imaginable. Marble staircases, vestibules adorned with palms,
beautiful little gardens, at all sorts of levels, outside the windows of
the various offices. Everywhere flowers. If the town rates in Genoa
are paid at the Town Hall, the paying of them must be almost
pleasant. One would go with that horrible demand note, if that is
used also in Italy, and fancy that one was arriving at a ball. The
palm-decorated entrance looks just like it. It only needs a lady
rate collector, such as one hears of in England, and one surely, in
whatever manner the Italians may say it, would beg the charming
signora to give one the honour and pleasure of a dance, and scribble
her name on the programme&mdash;I mean the demand note. And no
doubt, the Italian officials being leisurely and the space being ample,
one could find time for a waltz in the intervals of rate paying, or at
least sit it out in one of the delightful little gardens of this ideal
Palazzo Municipale.</p>

<p>And so farewell to sunny Genoa, and off to Turin. German hotel
again, German proprietor, German servants. Solitary German
visitor drinking his morning coffee. The hotels of Turin are not
crowded; he and I are alone. What will the poor man do? He
must talk his awful language to someone. He shan't talk it to me,
for I will pretend I do not understand even one word. The waiter
has left the room. Must the poor man be silent? Thunderweather,
ah no! Happilywise he is saved. The considerate proprietor,
thoughtful of his countryman's needs, enters; he stands by the
visitor's table, and the talk begins. When it ends I cannot say, for
I leave them, well started and in good voice, and hear, as I think,
their sweetly melodious phrases for the last time in Italy. The
train carries me away. There is not much more of Italy now, for
here is the Mont Cenis tunnel. Farewell, beautiful country, beautiful
pictures, beautiful language! There is someone leaning out of
the next carriage window. No doubt he is also saddened; he is
speaking to others inside, his voice is cheerful, he is evidently
trying not to give way to despair. Now I hear what he says, "<i>Da
werde ich ein Glas Bier trinken, ja, ja, ja!</i>"</p>
